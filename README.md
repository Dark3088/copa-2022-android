Match Notifier App
==================

This project is the final solution for the "Formação Android Developer" Course, provided
by [Digital Innovation One](https://www.dio.me) - An Information Technology teaching platform.

App Overview
------------

The project uses retrofit to make an asynchronous request and, if successful, render a list
of the World Cup Matches, along with their specific information. From this point, we can:

- Expand any item of the list to view its details
- Set a notification for the event
- Cancel a notification previously set
- Receive a notification for a specific match
